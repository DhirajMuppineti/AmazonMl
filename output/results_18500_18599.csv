18521,41ypTNQbmCL.jpg,"The depth of the wall-mounted lamp is indicated by two measurements. The circular plate that attaches to the wall has a diameter of 12cm (4.7 inches), and the overall height, including the adjustable neck, is 34cm (13.4 inches). However, since there are no explicit measurements provided for the depth in this image, we can only infer it from these dimensions. Typically, such lamps have a small protrusion from the backplate where they attach to the wall, which would be considered part of the depth. Given the standard design, one might expect the depth to be approximately equal to or slightly less than the diameter of the plate, which would be around 12cm. Without an exact measurement provided, we cannot give a precise numerical value for the depth."
